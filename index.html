                        <p style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">Whether it was the PATRIOT ACT, illegal NSA wiretapping or local surveillance cameras, our
                            government has used 9/11 to increase its surveillance and control over us. Corporations have increased
                            their spying on employees in order to get more work out of them. The arguments for each step on the road
                            to a surveillance state may sound convincing, but that road leads to less control by people and more by
                            government and corporate elites. Terrorists may attack the open society, but only governments can abolish it. Blase will prevent that from happening. PATRIOT ACT must be repealed, nothing left of it will remain. The NSA, the FBI, the ATF, the CIA, they must be either abolished in its entirety or
                            consolidated into one department with a severely limited scope at best.</p>

                        Reform</h2>
                        <p style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">The Founding Fathers created our copyright laws to promote knowledge & culture by giving the creator a
                            limited monopoly over their creations. Congress, under the influence of corporations, has extended the
                            duration of that government granted monopoly to seventy years after the death of the creator. Increasingly
                            corporations have sought broader laws to ensure that they control and profit from more of our culture.
                            Through Digital Rights Management (DRM) technologies they have locked down our culture, hindered
                            sharing and criminalized their customers. Blase will:
                            <ul style="padding-left:100px; padding-right: 100px;">
                                <li>limit the copyright to five years for electronic media and fourteen years for tangible objects,
                                </li>
                                <li>make sure that all non-commercial copying, sharing and remixing are legal and ban DRM software.
                                </li>
                                <li>There is no reason for copyright to continue until 70 years after death.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>
                        <p style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">
                            Everyone must have equal access to the internet, and Blase will help and fight to foster network neutrality so that
                            internet service providers cannot give preferential treatment to preferred web sites and we oppose three
                            strikes laws that ban anyone from using the internet because of copyright violations. The internet has the
                            potential to be a new Library of Alexandria, if we don't let corporations and governments lock it down.
                        </p>
                    <h2 style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px; color: #007a1a">Opening up our Government</h2>
                        <p style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">In order for citizens to control their democratic destiny, we need to know what our government is doing
                            and which special interests are influencing our public elected officials. Increasingly government officials
                            ignore open meeting laws, make deals favorable to corporations behind closed doors and sell off your
                            public information to private interests. Some state laws prevent people from recording public officials in
                            their duties, such as a police officer making an arrest, but the police cameras can record your actions
                            without your permission. Blase will make sure that our government is transparent and
                            accountable to the people.</p>
                    <h2 style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px; color: #007a1a">People before Corporations or Government</h2>
                        <p style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">The The Supreme Court and Congress have expanded the power of corporations for over a hundred years and
                            made them more powerful than people. Whether it is the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision that
                            allows corporations to buy elections, or Congress' cuts in corporate tax rates while raising payroll taxes,
                            real people end up with the short end of the stick. Blase will make sure our laws put people
                            before corporations.
                        </p>
                    <h2 style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px; color: #007a1a">Neuter the Authority of the Executive Branch and a
                        Absolute Rejection of the Unitary Executive Theory</h2>
                        <p style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">Separation of Powers is a pillar of our Republic. It makes sure that each branch of our government, the
                            legislature, the executive and the judicial, all operate on the same level. That one branch can’t be more
                            powerful than the other. Ever since Lincoln, the Executive Branch has exceeded its bounds of power to
                            the point of being a constitutional crisis and we treat the Presidency as no more than a king.</p>
                        <p style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px; color: #007a1a;">
                            And it has culminated in the Unitary Executive Theory. An abomination that should have never been
                            allowed to propagate in US legal theory. We firmly and absolutely reject the Unitary Executive Theory
                            and advocate for the decentralization and decreasing the authority of the executive and bring power back
                            to congress and the judicial system where separation of powers remain as it was.
                        </p>
                    <h2 style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px; color: #007a1a">Digital Bill of Rights</h2>
                        <p style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">We support a Digital Bill of Rights to help protect the privacy and freedom from users of the Internet to
                            Video Game players. We all deserve the freedom and privacy the Internet gives us and for the government
                            and corporations to deny it to us is unacceptable. Therefore a Digital Bill of Rights is imperative for the
                            future of the Digital World that such freedom and privacy is sacrosanct, regardless the intentions of
                            governments or corporations.

                        <p style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">We proudly condemn bigotry as irrational and repugnant. We believe this behavior to be fundamentally incompatible with our core values. Pirates stand for everyone, even when others do not.</p>
                    <h2 style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px; color: #007a1a">Police Reform</h2>
                        <p style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">We believe that major police reform is not only a legitimate idea, but a necessity. Due to the divisive and
                            hot button nature of this topic, the USPP is dedicated to finding quality solutions that can be agreed upon
                            by the vast majority. Here are a few steps we can take towards reform:
                            <ul style="padding-left:100px; padding-right: 100px;">
                                <li>Demilitarize the police through actions such as ending the 1033 Program and discouraging
                                    technique sharing between the neighborhood police and the military or federal intelligence
                                    agencies;
                                </li>
                                <li>End qualified immunity and hold officers accountable when they break the law;
                                </li>
                                <li>End civil asset forfeiture and its enabling of “slush funds” to be used for any purpose;
                                </li>
                                <li>Invest money into community care instead of more policing, especially in areas currently
                                    impacted by over-policing;
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Require warrants for all forms of surveillance and end no-knock warrants;
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Force departments to collect statistics in order to outline biases in enforcement and which
                                    enforcement methods are better for the community;
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Ensure nobody is put in jail for actions of basic survival;
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Properly train our police forces with regular training in all aspects of the job. This will include but
                                    not limited to mental health assessments, first responder medical certification, community
                                    policing, & public engagement.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">There are many things that must be done in order to fix the issues with policing in our country. There are
                            also many different end goals that many different people have in mind. What we need right now is an
                            honest, no-nonsense start to the process, and that is what the USPP hopes to achieve.</p>
                    <h2 style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px; color: #007a1a">Drug Decriminalization</h2>
                        <p style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">The War on Drugs has been a stain and a black eye on our country for half a decade. And what has been
                            the end result? What have we gained? Nothing but high incarceration rates, broken communities, black
                            and hispanic communities targeted just because, countless deaths and murder, and the militarization of the
                            police force. Turning America into a police state just to fight this war is a zero sum with nothing to gain.

                            of women to choose whether or not to keep the baby because at the end of the day, only we can decide
                            what’s best for us, not a governmental administration that may not have the best intentions in regards to

                            Many studies have shown that Abortion bans and restrictions have significant negative impacts on
                            women's economic and educational outcomes, often leading to decreased income, higher rates of poverty,
                            lower educational attainment, poorer health, and reduced social support. While access to abortion has
                            been linked to higher income, increased college graduation rates, greater financial stability, better health
                            outcomes, and enhanced social and educational opportunities.

                            And such Abortion bans coinciding with bad sexual education and peer pressured if not enforced
                            Abstinence only programs from the State down to the parents only increases teen pregnancy and doesn’t
                            reduce them since teens can’t be stopped from having sex with each other without a stronger China-like
                            surveillance system. Especially considering this <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/yrbs/dstr/index.html">study</a> here that says 30% of teens are having and will
                            have sex, mostly without contraception and no sex education.

                            It’s one thing to believe Abortion is morally wrong and don’t want an abortion for themselves or their
                            partner. It’s another thing to pretend that everyone wants the same thing and there won’t be consequences
                            for such. A Pro-Choice policy is the only acceptable position, with varying limits or preferences, that can
                            not only ensure the woman’s health and their social and economic outcomes. And to also prevent the

                            gun access and just red meat for the voting base that wants a Free Gun America. Which to many gun

                            minimum of regard for citizens rights. And then in the same breath want to give such authoritarian powers
                            that many gun control proposals would give them. If the police are the horrid enforcement agency that we
                            criticize them for, then why give them more power and authority through gun control? It’s just

                                    A Comprehensive subsidiary and guideline program for mass media, from Fox News to CNN to
                                    PBS, to responsibly cover mass shootings without going into 24/7 constant news coverage that
                                    will just inspire other mass shooters. Many studies have confirmed a link between constant mass
                                    media coverage and mass shootings mainly because mass shootings fall into the same problem as
                                    copycat suicides. They are not new. They are done with the intention of attention and fame or in
                                    this case infamy. In other words, copycat mass killings. We need to treat these shooters as the
                                    nsignificant bugs as they are and have the media responsibly cover them instead of giving them
                                    the infamy that they want. We are not interested in trying to protect the 2nd Amendment just to
                                    violate the First and vice versa. It shouldn’t have to be one or the other here.

                                    We advocate for lifting sanctions on countries who only have said sanctions because we
                                    disapprove of their government.

                                    We advocate for legislation which ensures our government and intelligence agencies do not
                                    interfere in any elections in Europe, Africa, Asia or any part of the American Continent and that
                                    the will of the people is respected.

                            This would likely require quite a significant foreign policy change on the USA's part, however. The US
                            has made a lot of missteps along the way, so we should make the first steps to fix them.
